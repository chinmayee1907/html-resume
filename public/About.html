    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Current undergraduate student with strong communication, critical 
        thinking, and problem-solving skills developed through my teaching 
        assistant and student ambassador roles. Alongside my technical 
        knowledge gained from my university studies, I am eager to expand 
        my experience and expertise through a summer internship. With a 
        strategic and creative mindset, along with advanced Excel and 
        PowerPoint skills, I am well-equipped to handle multiple 
        assignments and meet deadlines effectively. I am seeking to apply 
        my academic achievements and technical aptitude in a collaborative 
        and dynamic environment that fosters growth and excellence.</p>
